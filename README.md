The purpose of this application is to compare and contrast applications on Apple's "App Store" and the "Google Play" store. Our vision for the layout of the web-page begins with a search box on top of the page, after a 
search is entered, two boxes below show the search results for the App Store and Google play store respectively. When a search result is clicked on, it will link to a app review page which will give a description of the application and
the application's user rating. In addition to the search process our web-page will allow users to add apps and comment on a forum.
